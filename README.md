# Algorithm_and_Data_Structure_Self_Learning
This is a repository of me learning Algorithms and Data Structure Hopefully when I am done, by November(2021) max I have got a Job at Turing

Day 1:
Understanding Linked List and Coding it
improved the code and make it look a little more professional.

Day 2:
Did more project on linked list, it's fun but brain tasking cuz OMO!!
Understanding Stacks, Stacks are cool and less stressfull tho,
Understanding Queues, Deques, Priority Queue,  it's getting more fun
Time for some more research on implementation of List based collections
