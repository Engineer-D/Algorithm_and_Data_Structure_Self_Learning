# Algorithm_and_Data_Structure_Self_Learning
This is a repository of me learning Algorithms and Data Structure Hopefully when I am done, by November(2021) max I have got a Job at Turing

Day 1:
Understanding Linked List and Coding it
improved the code and make it look a little more professional.

Day 2:
Did more project on linked list, it's fun but brain tasking cuz OMO!!
Understanding Stacks, Stacks are cool and less stressfull tho,
Understanding Queues, Deques, Priority Queue,  it's getting more fun
Time for some more research on implementation of List based collections

Day 3:
    Binary Search Algorithm, Now Diving into Algorithms proper proper. 
Quite shameful I couldn't solve this on my own, Understood the algorithm but couldn't implement
I am determined to get the next one, We move!!!
Okay for the Binary Search recursive I reall tried on my own, Much improvement but still not there yet
Moved quickly to recursion and Damn!! that's one hella Algorithm, Applied it to Fibonnaci sequence
for the recursive approach I almost ran mad, guess I am actually overcalculating this stuffs because when
I got to see the answer I was annoyed same feeling I had when I saw the implementation of Binary search
We Mueve!
for the iterative approach I did well.

Day 4:
    Sorting Algorithms Interesting, BubbleSort quite cool and funny
    MergeSort also cool

Day 5:
    Picking up where we left from, QuickSort is cool still trying to wrap my
    head around it. would watch some vidoes online. Also checked out another stle of mergesort
    which I don't really fancy because of the the many loops in it and I feel space is being wasted

Been out for a while, Finally back on track. 
Done with Udacity course now solving Algorithms and Developing myself
